# Password_Generator

Instructions:

The program will ask:
1. How many letters would you like in your password?
2. How many symbols would you like?
3. How many numbers would you like?

The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge of Java's Arrays, ArrayList, and loops to complete the challenge.

The final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:
x$d24g*f9

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
